    <p>During my time at school I had the opportunity to collaborate with other students on many large projects including data base design/implementation and game design/implementation. I learned from these experiences the importance of group dynamics and my role in that and I feel I am becoming a stonger team member as I go along. I am a person who enjoys learning new things and working through problems. I like puzzles and I enjoy mathematics. The reason I chose CS is because it offers this cohesion between creativity and analytics and the opportunity to build things from the ground up using words and logic. There is something kind of beautiful and magical about it. I have experience working with python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL and also some C++. My goal in the immediate is to connect with an internship or an entry level position in the field of CS. I am eager and excited to take these next steps post-graduation and to learn and grow. Any advice or guidance would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time.
